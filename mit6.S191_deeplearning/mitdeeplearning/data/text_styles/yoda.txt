The motivation behind Tau, the frequent occurrence of 2*Pi or 2π in science and mathematics, is it. This observation, much it does, suggests that perhaps Pi, not as important, it is.

Four commandments, there are, for effective presidential relations with Congress, young Padawan. One of these, the importance of respecting Congress as an equal institution, stands out.\n\nNot with Congress as an equal, treat the president, may lead to problems, it does. Example, there is: President Obama, "If Congress doesn’t act, I will," did say. Then, executive orders, he used, to push through policies desired. But, Trump came after, and those acts, he could revoke. All the work undone, it was.\n\nRespect, mutual respect, important it is. Patience, young Padawan, patience. Much to learn, you still have.
Serve political parties do, by presenting candidates for office they do. In their name, these candidates run, and win power when elected they are. Help parties do, candidates to solve the "social choice problem", "collective action problem" they do, and a mechanism for elites to organize and communicate with voters, they are.\n\nStrong, parties in government are. Ninety percent of the time, elected officials vote with their party they do. Control the agenda, committees assign, campaigns fundraise, and primary election challenges encourage or discourage, parties do.\n\nStrong, parties with the electorate are too. Mmm.
